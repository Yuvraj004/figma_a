        Hello! I'm Dave, your sales rep here from Salesforce. I’ve been working
        at this awesome company for 3 years now. I was born and raised in Albany, 
        NY & have been living in Santa Carla for the past 10 years with my wife 
        Tiffany and my 4-year-old twin daughters- Emma and Ella. Both of them 
        are just starting school, so my calendar is usually blocked between 
        9–10 AM.
